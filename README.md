# Computational Statistics & Data Analysis
These notebooks were first created as solutions to task assignmnets for the lecture Computational Statistics & Data Analysis at University of Heidelberg in the
Summer term of 2022 held by Prof. Luca Amendola. I revised them again and explored further possibilities with the data before uploading them here. <br>
Note, that none of these notebooks are official solutions to the course published by U of Heidelberg but merely my humble personal approach.
